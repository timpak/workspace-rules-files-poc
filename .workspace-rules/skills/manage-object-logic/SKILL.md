description: Add business logic to Liferay Objects via object actions, workflow definitions, and notification templates. Use when the user asks to send a notification on create, trigger an action on update, wire a workflow, or automate any response to object entry lifecycle events. Maps to the Business Logic and Automation section of "Mastering Data Modeling with Liferay Objects".

# Manage Object Logic

Attach triggers, conditions, and actions to object definitions. The three extension points are object actions (immediate), Kaleo workflows (multi-step approval), and notification templates (user-facing messages).

## When to Invoke

- "Send a notification when a Book is created"
- "Trigger a webhook on order update"
- "Wire an approval workflow to this object"
- "Run a Groovy script after an entry is deleted"
- Called by `build-site` during the logic phase

## Prerequisites

Object definition must already exist and be published (see `manage-objects`). Client Extension actions require the CET to be deployed first (see `scaffold-client-extension`).

## Workflow

### 1. Choose the Trigger

| Trigger | When It Fires |
| --- | --- |
| `onAfterAdd` | After an entry is created |
| `onAfterUpdate` | After an entry is updated |
| `onAfterDelete` | After an entry is deleted |
| `standalone` | On-demand, invoked explicitly by a user or API call |

### 2. Choose the Action Type

Consult `rules/object-actions-catalog.md` for the full catalog. Summary:

| Action Type | Payload | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Notification | Template ID | Sends in-app or email notification |
| `addObjectEntry` | Definition name + field map | Creates an entry in another object |
| `updateObjectEntry` | Entry ID + field map | Updates an entry in the same or another object |
| Webhook | URL + secret | HTTP POST to external endpoint |
| Groovy Script | Script body | Only on self-hosted or PaaS; not available on Liferay SaaS |
| Client Extension | CET `objectAction` or `workflowAction` externalReferenceCode | Calls a deployed microservice |

### 3a. Object Action — Notification

Create a notification template first if one does not exist:

```bash
curl -s -u "test@liferay.com:test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "http://localhost:${PORT}/o/notification/v1.0/notification-templates" \
  -d '{
    "body": {"en_US": "A new [%OBJECT_FIELD_NAME%] was created."},
    "description": "",
    "editorType": "richText",
    "name": "<TemplateName>",
    "objectDefinitionExternalReferenceCode": "<objectERC>",
    "recipientType": "user",
    "subject": {"en_US": "New entry created"},
    "type": "email"
  }'
```

Save the returned `id` as `<template-id>`. Then create the action:

```bash
curl -s -u "test@liferay.com:test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "http://localhost:${PORT}/o/object-admin/v1.0/object-definitions/<definition-id>/object-actions" \
  -d '{
    "active": true,
    "label": {"en_US": "<ActionLabel>"},
    "name": "<actionName>",
    "objectActionExecutorKey": "notification",
    "objectActionTriggerKey": "onAfterAdd",
    "parameters": {
      "notificationTemplateId": <template-id>
    }
  }'
```

### 3b. Object Action — Webhook

```bash
curl -s -u "test@liferay.com:test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "http://localhost:${PORT}/o/object-admin/v1.0/object-definitions/<definition-id>/object-actions" \
  -d '{
    "active": true,
    "label": {"en_US": "<ActionLabel>"},
    "name": "<actionName>",
    "objectActionExecutorKey": "webhook",
    "objectActionTriggerKey": "onAfterAdd",
    "parameters": {
      "secret": "<hmac-secret>",
      "url": "<https://endpoint.example.com/hook>"
    }
  }'
```

### 3c. Object Action — Client Extension

First deploy the `objectAction` CET via `scaffold-client-extension`. Then reference its `externalReferenceCode`:

```bash
curl -s -u "test@liferay.com:test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "http://localhost:${PORT}/o/object-admin/v1.0/object-definitions/<definition-id>/object-actions" \
  -d '{
    "active": true,
    "label": {"en_US": "<ActionLabel>"},
    "name": "<actionName>",
    "objectActionExecutorKey": "objectAction",
    "objectActionTriggerKey": "onAfterAdd",
    "parameters": {
      "clientExtensionEntryExternalReferenceCode": "<cet-erc>"
    }
  }'
```

The executor key for a Client Extension action is `"objectAction"` (not `"groovy"` — that key is only for the inline Groovy executor in §3a/§3b's sibling pattern). See `rules/object-actions-catalog.md`.

### 4. Kaleo Workflow

Deploy a workflow definition when the object requires multi-step review or approval.

```bash
curl -s -u "test@liferay.com:test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "http://localhost:${PORT}/o/headless-admin-workflow/v1.0/workflow-definitions" \
  -d '{
    "active": true,
    "name": "<WorkflowName>",
    "title": {"en_US": "<Workflow Title>"},
    "content": "<escaped XML or JSON workflow definition>"
  }'
```

After creating, associate the workflow with the object definition. The reliable path is the Control Panel (Objects → \<Definition\> → Actions → Workflow). There is **no** `workflow-definitions/{id}/assign-to-object` endpoint; programmatic association is done through the `workflow-definition-links` resource (`POST /o/headless-admin-workflow/v1.0/workflow-definitions/<id>/workflow-definition-links`) — confirm the request body against the OpenAPI spec (`get-openapi` MCP tool, or `GET /o/headless-admin-workflow/v1.0/openapi.json`) before scripting it, as the link payload (workflow, class name, type pk) is version-sensitive.

### 5. Verify Object Actions

```bash
curl -s -u "test@liferay.com:test" \
  "http://localhost:${PORT}/o/object-admin/v1.0/object-definitions/<definition-id>/object-actions" \
  | jq '[.items[] | {name, objectActionTriggerKey, objectActionExecutorKey, active}]'
```

Confirm each action is `"active": true`.

### 6. Test the Trigger

Create a test entry and check the expected side effect (email received, webhook payload, other entry created):

```bash
curl -s -u "test@liferay.com:test" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "http://localhost:${PORT}/o/c/<pluralLabel>/" \
  -d '{"<fieldName>": "test value"}'
```

## Common Gotchas

### Object Action Re-fire Loop

`onAfterUpdate` fires on **every** REST PATCH — including PATCHes made by the action itself. If your action writes back to the same record via REST, it will loop.

**Safe path**: call `ObjectEntryLocalServiceUtil.updateObjectEntry` directly from within the Object Action. Direct service-layer calls do **not** re-trigger the Object Action — only REST API calls do. Use this pattern for any script that needs to update the same record it is acting on.

### Groovy Output Binding

Object Action Groovy scripts have no `out` binding. Use bare `println` to write to `catalina.out`. Using `out.println` throws `No such property: out`.

### Diagnostic Action Hygiene

Stale diagnostic Object Actions are a silent data hazard: they continue firing on every matching event after a session ends and can revert data changes at unexpected times — often with no error, just a wrong value in the database. Secondary concern: they accumulate output in `catalina.out` and interleave with real logs.

Rules:

- Prefix all diagnostic actions with `diag-` (e.g., `diag-check-balance`).
- Delete all `diag-` actions before shipping — they are not safe to leave running in any persistent environment.
- Bulk delete when done: filter by name prefix in Control Panel → Objects → [Object] → Actions, or via the Object Admin REST API.

### Type Safety in Groovy

Never pass interpolated strings (`"${var}"`) to Liferay Service APIs. Groovy `GStringImpl` causes cast exceptions. Always use explicit string concatenation: `"" + var`.
